                data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
                Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature,
                make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many

                core component of Sun's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
                machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
                2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of
                its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual
                Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source
                software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</td>

                oxide). Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable. Other varieties of
                gem-quality corundum are called sapphires. Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, alongside
                amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond.[3] The word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red. The color of
                a ruby is due to the element chromium.</td>

                general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First
                released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over
                time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities
                for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like
                Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
                compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and
                IBM.[14]</td>
